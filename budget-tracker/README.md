# Budget Tracker  

## Project Description  
The Budget Tracker application uses React to track the user's expenses as they enter them. The user's expenses are visible in a table that shows the item and its cost. The user's expense total can be seen at the top of the page and is updated as more expenses are added.

## Instructions for Use
There is a form that takes in an item's name and price. Fill out these two fields and click the "Add Expense" button everytime you wish to add an item. The table and expense total will update each time.
